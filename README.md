# jhona.tn site

Main personal site. Also, a demostration of how to build a simple site without proper web design knowledge.

## What's in here

This is a website built using [Flutter]((https://flutter.dev/)). It includes a "splash screen" made using HTML+SVG+CSS, so it loads faster than the Flutter engine.

Also, this repository has [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) set up, so it gets built and deployed after a code push, and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so content within this repo can be used as a website.

## Building and Editing

This project can be built locally using [a web-ready installation of Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web#requirements). Also, this project was written using [Microsoft Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so there are VSCode-specific settings. If you're trying to build this project using a different tool, you will need to add the build parameter `--no-sound-null-safety`

The Github Pages settings are inside the `.github/workflows` folder. Here, for my own usage, this site is ready for use at jhona.tn
